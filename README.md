## Welcome to Worfit Landing Page! ðŸ‘‹

This was my first ever project of web development made from scratch. It was made using HTML and CSS.

## The Challenge

The idea was to recreate a landing page for a fictional company using a Figma file as a reference. This project was mostly an exercise of CSS layout with the best professional approach possible.

## The tools

My approach was to create the website without using any frameworks or libraries. The landing page has a mix of CSS grid with CSS flexbox in some elements. Also, I made the website responsive using media queries. 

The files of this project: images, HTML content and Figma files were provided by Frontend Mentor.
