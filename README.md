## Welcome to Workit Landing Page! ðŸ‘‹

This was my first ever project of web development made from scratch. It was made using HTML and CSS.


This is a solution to the [Workit Landing Page!](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/workit-landing-page-2fYnyle5lu)

Frontend Mentor challenges help to improve coding skills by building realistic projects.

## Overview

### The challenge

The challenge is to build out this landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

The users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup.
- Flexbox.
- CSS Grid.

### What I learned

- This is my first ever project of Front End. This is a new version of the original repository that I upload to GitHub. In this version, I remade the website entirely and fix some issues with media queries and responsiveness.


### What can be improve

- HTML can be more semantic and CSS could be implemented with BEM.
