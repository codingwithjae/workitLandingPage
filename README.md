## Welcome to Worfit Landing Page! ðŸ‘‹

This was my first ever project of web development made from scratch. It was made using HTML and CSS.


This is a solution to the [Worfit Landing Page!](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/workit-landing-page-2fYnyle5lu). 

Frontend Mentor challenges help to improve coding skills by building realistic projects.

## Overview

### The challenge

The challenge is to build out this landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

The users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
